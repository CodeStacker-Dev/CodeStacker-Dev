# About Me 👨‍💻🎉

Hi, I'm **CodeStacker-Dev**, a curious developer and tinkerer passionate about **hardware and firmware hacking**. While I'm primarily a Windows user, I’ve recently ventured into the Linux world by modding my Chromebook to run **Debian** 🐧, and I’m loving the learning experience so far.

## 🎯 My Interests:
- 🛠️ **Hardware Hacking**: Exploring embedded systems, microcontrollers, and low-level programming.
- 🔧 **Firmware Development**: Digging into bootloaders, firmware mods, and device recovery techniques.
- 🪟 **Windows + Development**: As a full Windows application/program developer, working in the Windows environment is second nature to me.
- 🖥️ **Linux Adventures**: Expanding my skills with Debian and other Linux tools for hardware and firmware projects.
- 🚀 **Adventurous Projects**: I'm always up for exploring new ideas with any hardware or firmware.

## 🤫 A Secret Project:
I’m on the lookout for collaborators who can help create **PCBs** for a **cheap, open-source router** with plenty of GPIO support and custom-made firmware. If that’s something you’re passionate about, feel free to reach out! 💡

## 📬 How to Reach Me:

I’m planning to get a personal website soon 🌐, but for now, I’m focusing on my current projects. Let’s learn, create, and hack together! 🤖✨
